## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability please DO NOT share it with others and keep it a confidential information. Report security vulnerabilities in our [support server](https://discord.gg/v2Y83Numgf).

Your report will be analized and fixed as soon as possible. These reports are prioritized.
If your report is accepted proper actions will be taken and the vulnerability will be fixed. If your report gets denied, it is probably due to it being about an unsupported version of this extension or not being valid.
